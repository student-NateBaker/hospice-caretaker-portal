**WebApp with Chatbot Integration (Google Gemini AI)**
This is a full-stack web application that utilizes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python (Flask), SQL, and integrates Google’s Gemini AI for a chatbot feature. The app allows users to interact with an intelligent chatbot powered by Gemini AI, manage data with a SQL database, and enjoy a responsive front-end built with HTML and CSS.

**Features**
Chatbot Interaction: Powered by Google Gemini AI, the chatbot can answer questions, provide assistance, and guide users.
Responsive UI: Built with HTML and CSS, optimized for both desktop and mobile views.
Flask Backend: A Python-based web server for handling API requests, routes, and integration with Google Gemini AI.
SQL Database: Stores user data and chatbot interactions in a relational database.
JavaScript: Manages dynamic content and interactivity on the front-end.
**Prerequisites**
To run this web app, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

Python (version 3.x or higher)
Node.js and npm (for JavaScript dependencies)
SQL Database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite)
Google Gemini API credentials (for the chatbot)
Python Libraries:
To install the required Python libraries, use:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
The requirements.txt file includes:

Flask
SQLAlchemy (for database interaction)
Requests (for API calls)
dotenv (for managing environment variables)
JavaScript Libraries:
For managing front-end dependencies, run:

bash
npm install
This installs libraries such as jQuery (if used) or any other front-end packages listed in package.json.

**Setup and Configuration
Step 1: Clone the Repository**
Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/webapp-with-chatbot.git
cd webapp-with-chatbot
**Step 2: Set Up Environment Variables**
Create a .env file in the root directory and add your Google Gemini AI credentials and database configuration. Example:

makefile
Copy code
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_gemini_api_key
DB_URI=your_database_uri
**Step 3: Set Up the Database**
Create a SQL database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, etc.).
Run the following command to set up the necessary tables:
bash
python manage.py db init
python manage.py db migrate
python manage.py db upgrade
**Step 4: Start the Flask Application**
Run the Flask application locally:

bash
python app.py
By default, the app will be available at http://localhost:5000.

**Step 5: Use the Chatbot**
Once the app is running, visit the homepage, and you will see the chatbot interface. Start chatting with the bot powered by Google Gemini AI. The chatbot will send messages to the backend, which then processes them via the Gemini API and sends back a response.

**Step 6: Deploy to Production (Optional)**
You can deploy the application using any hosting service like:
Heroku
AWS (Amazon Web Services)
Google Cloud Platform
DigitalOcean
Refer to the respective platform's documentation for deployment instructions.
